# odin-recipes
The purpose of this project is to construct the framework of a website detailing three different recipes.

The web site consists of a home page containing links to three recipes of my choosing. Each of these links will take the user to the corresponding recipe's page which has an image of the dish, the dish's ingredients, and steps to prepare the dish.

The main learning outcomes of this project are:
1. Gain familiarity with HTML and creating the basic framework of a website.
2. Practice using absolute and relative links with images and other web pages.
3. Utilize both ordered and unordered lists.
4. Gain familiarity with the Git workflow and writing frequent, clear, and concise Git commit messages.
